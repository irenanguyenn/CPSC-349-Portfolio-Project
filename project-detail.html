                <h1>BackTracker</h1>
                <p><b>Description:</b> BackTracker is a budget tracking web application that helps users manage their finances effectively. 
                    It enables users to log transactions, categorize expenses, and visualize their financial habits with dynamic charts and 
                    reports. The project focuses on providing an intuitive and responsive interface for seamless financial management.
                 </p>
                <p><b>Technologies Used:</b> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b> Features: </b> 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Expense Tracking</li>
                        <li> Data Visualizaion</li>
                        <li> Responsive Design</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>Challenges:</b> 
                <ul>
                    <li> Displaying updated financial data dynamically while maintaing performance was difficult as it was too much for the 
                        system to handle. Libraries like Chart.js were integrated to generate responsive, real-time visualtions and optimized 
                        data handling for speed. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Since the project is intended to help clients keep track of expenses, data is being handle. To ensure no data loss would 
                        occur, data was enrypted and stored in the browser as well as user authentication was essential.
                    </li>
                </ul></p>
                <p><b>Outcome:</b>BackTracker successfully delivered a streamlined budgeting experience. Users were able to categorize expenses, 
                    track financial progress, and gain insights into their spending habits. The responsive design ensured accessibility across devices, 
                    enhancing user experience.</p>
